<p>We depend on volunteers to produce our traditional music festivals. We need your help.<br />We're using SignUp.com (formerly known as VolunteerSpot) to organize our festival volunteers this year. Here's how it works:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li><a title="2016 Volunteer Sign Up" href="http://signup.com/go/71pRYi" target="_blank">Click this link to see our 2016 ASBF Sign-Up on SignUp.com</a></li>
    <li>The main volunteer page contains links to individual sign ups for each crew. <br />Choose your crew and click View to see the spots.</li>
    <li>When prompted, enter and confirm your email address, or sign in with Facebook.</li>
    <li>Review the options listed and choose the spot(s) you like.</li>
    <li>Enter your name.</li>
    <li>Enter your cell phone number, only so we can contact you at the festival, if necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't want to get any solicitation emails from SignUp.com, please uncheck the check boxes that ask if you want
    to receive special offers. SignUp.com will not share your email or phone number with anyone.
    However, they will send you emails if you do not uncheck the box.</p>

<p>Work one shift-get a one day pass for that day. To encourage evening shifts, volunteers for Friday or Saturday evening shift
    (shifts ending at 9pm or later) at Gate, Merchandise, or Food services will get a weekend pass.
    Thursday and Sunday volunteers will also receive a weekend pass. Volunteers that work two shifts
    will receive a weekend pass plus a meal ticket.</p>
