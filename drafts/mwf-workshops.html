    <p>Leon will present two western swing tunes with old time guitar parts: Stay all Night and Faded Love. Stay all Night, which has a breakdown fiddle introduction, showing the accompaniment with cowboy chords (first position chords), then in Texas old time fiddle accompaniment style, and then the Eldon Shamblin take on it. Faded Love (Darling Nellie Gray), with the same three styles presented. Time permitting, I&#39;ll add Right or Wrong in Eldon Shamblin style, discussing cycle of dominant seventh chords progressions. Tablature for the Texas old time and Shamblin versions will be provided.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:0">Deep Roots: History and Songs of Migrant Texas Cedar Choppers</h3>

    <p><strong>1pm to 2pm, Room 105</strong></p>

    <p>For nearly 100 years a small but infamous sect, better known as Cedar Choppers, camped, worked, and played, relatively undisturbed by outsiders, amongst the rugged hills of Central Texas. Much like their Appalachian ancestors, Cedar Chopper&#39;s camped in tight knit groups, where strangers were unwelcome, in effect insulating customs, allowing for a unique blend of Appalachian, Texas frontier, and cowboy cultures, as well popular culture from radio and community square dances. Journey back to that nearly forgotten time with an inside perspective along with sixth generation Texan and Cedar Chopper descendent Alexa Dee, as she shares her family&#39;s songs and history.</p>

Handouts with lots of information on resources, autoharp festivals, etc. will be available. Lindsay Haisley was a 2004 inductee into the Autoharp Hall of Fame.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0">Bob Leibman</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:0">Dance and music of the Balkans</h3>

    <p><strong>2 pm to 3pm, Room 105 </strong></p>

    <p>Visual and audio clips showing a variety of instrumental and vocal music as well as dancing. Depending on the audience we might also do some simple basic dances from various regions.</p>
    <p>Bob Leibman spent a considerable amount of time in villages in Macedonia and East Serbia, studying wedding customs and dance.
        Most of his folk dance teaching is of the dances he learned from villagers. Although he teaches dances that range in level of difficulty,
        most are easy enough for the majority of folk dancers to learn and enjoy. His more difficult dances are suitable for exhibition purposes.</p>
